# Root-Finding-Algorithms-Visualizer
A Root Finding Algorithms Visualizer project is a software tool designed to help users understand and visualize the behavior of various numerical methods for finding roots of mathematical equations. Root finding is a fundamental concept in numerical analysis and is commonly used in fields such as engineering, physics, computer science, and more. The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input mathematical functions and observe how root-finding algorithms iteratively converge to find solutions.

# Supported Algorithms:
Bisection Method: A simple algorithm that iteratively reduces the search interval by halving it.
Newton-Raphson Method: An iterative method that uses the derivative of the function to estimate the root.
Secant Method: A numerical approximation of the derivative used in the Newton-Raphson method.
Regula Falsi (False Position) Method: A variation of the bisection method that interpolates between two points.
Any other algorithms the project aims to support.
# Visualization:
The core of the project is the visualization of how these algorithms work. Users should be able to see the following:
The mathematical function they input.
The initial guess on the graph.
The convergence process, showing how the algorithms iteratively adjust the guess to get closer to the root.
The progression of the search interval for methods like bisection.
# Error Estimation:
Provide error estimation and display how the error decreases as the iteration progresses.
User Control:
Allow users to control the speed of visualization, pause, resume, or step through the iterations.
Offer the option to switch between different algorithms for comparison.
# Result Presentation:
Display the final root that each algorithm converges to and provide a summary of the number of iterations taken.
Error Analysis:
Include error analysis tools that show how the choice of initial guess and algorithm affects convergence.
Documentation and Tutorials:
Include detailed documentation and tutorials on how to use the tool effectively, explaining the theory behind the algorithms and practical examples.
Extensibility:
Make the project extensible so that additional root-finding algorithms can be added in the future.
